xen (2.0.4-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bah, major booboo.  Add /boot to debian/xen.install, so xen.gz will
    get shipped.  Reported by Clint Adams <schizo@debian.org>.

 -- Adam Heath <doogie@brainfood.com>  Tue, 15 Feb 2005 13:00:57 -0600

xen (2.0.4-3) experimental; urgency=low

    xen-docs.  Reported by Tupshin Harper <tupshin@tupshin.com>.

xen (2.0.4-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix kernel patch generation.  It was broken when I integrated with
    debian's kernel source.  I used a symlink, and diff doesn't follow
    those.

 -- Adam Heath <doogie@brainfood.com>  Sat, 05 Feb 2005 18:16:35 -0600

xen (2.0.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream.
  * xen.deb can now install on a plain kernel; that is, the init scripts
    exit successfully if /proc/xen/privcmd doesn't exist.  This allows
    for dual-boot setups.
  * Manpages do not yet exist xend, xenperf, xensv, xfrd, nor xm.  xend
    xfrd are daemons, and take little if any options.  I've not had a need
    to use xenperf nor xensv yet.  xm has nice built in help(xm help).
  * Upstream now requires either linux 2.4.29, or 2.6.10.  Since 2.4.29 is
    not yet in debian, disable the 2.4 patch generation.  Closes: #271245.
  * Not certain how the kernel-patch-xen was empty.  It's not now, with
    the repackaging.  Closes: #272299.
  * Xen no longer produces kernel images, so problems about missing features
    are no longer valid.  Closes: #253924.
  * Acknowledge nmu bugs:
    * No longer build-depend on gcc 3.3, as the default gcc works. Closes:
      #243048.

  * New upstream.  Closes: #280733.
  * Repackaged from scratch.
  * Using unreleased patch management system.  See debian/README.build.
    * After extracting the .dsc, there are no special steps needed
    * Those wanting to change the source, use the normal procedures for
      any package, including using interdiff(or other tool) to send a
      patch to me or the bts.
  * No longer try to do anything fancy with regard to the layout of the
    built kernels.  Now, only patches are distributed.  Please make use of
    the xen support in kernel-package.
  * Early preview release to #debian-devel.
