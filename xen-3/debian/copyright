Xen was initially debianized by Adam Heath <doogie@brainfood.com>

It was downloaded from http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/netos/xen

The project is partially hosted on sourceforge.  It's homepage on sf redirects
to the above url. Part of the development is carried on at http://www.xensource.com

This is the header of Xen 3.0 upstream COPYING file which clarifies a bit how
the licence is meant to be applied. The file continues with the complete text
of the GNU General Public Licence version 2, which is not included here as it
can be found on Debian GNU/Linux systems in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.

<file "COPYING">
 XEN NOTICE
 ==========

This license does *not* cover guest operating systems that use
Xen services via normal hypercalls - this is merely considered normal
use of Xen, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the Xen
virtual machine monitor) is copyrighted by me and others who actually
wrote it.

Further note that the guest-OS interfacing header files, which
includes all files within the subdirectory include/public, are
*not* covered by the GPL but by a much weaker license:
 include/public/COPYING

Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as Xen is
concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (i.e., *only*
v2, not v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise
stated.

As an exception, for the convenience of users who want to port other operating
systems to Xen, some files are licensed under a BSD-style licence. This licence
applies to all the files under the xen/include/public directory inside the
upstream tarball. This is the content of the COPYING file in that directory:

XEN NOTICE

This copyright applies to all files within this subdirectory. All
other files in the Xen source distribution are covered by version 2 of
the GNU General Public License.
