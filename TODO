1. Fix upgrading:
	Don't shutdown xend/xendomains if upgrading to a minor new release
	
2. Contact glibc team:
	Ask if it's possible to build a non-segmented glibc for xen

	Test /etc/ld.so.hwnocap and maybe implement that in a init.d-script

4. Distribute xen unstable too?

5. Kernel team:
	Coordinate to have working dom0/domu images for x86 and amd64
