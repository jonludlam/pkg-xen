Description: a Virtual Machine Monitor like VMWare or plex86
 XEN is a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) originally developed by the
 Systems Research Group of the University of Cambridge Computer
 Laboratory, as part of the UK-EPSRC funded XenoServers project.
 .
 Xen enables multiple operating system images to execute concurrently
 on the same hardware with very low performance overhead --- much lower
 than commercial offerings for the same x86 platform.

Description: documentation for XEN, a Virtual Machine Monitor
 This package contains all the large documentation files for XEN.  This
 includes a description interface(both the api, and a nice explanation of
 how XEN works).  It also contains the VBD and Xeno howtos.

Package: libxen-python

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Description: python wrapper around libxc, the control library for XEN
 This python library wraps the C library, and provides a nice OO interface
 to the low-level system calls.  It also provides some higher-level config
 file parsing.
