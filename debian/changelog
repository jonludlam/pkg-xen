xen (3.0.1+hg8743-0+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "preserve our homes" release
  * Now cooperatively maintained by the Debian Xen Team
  * New upstream release (closes: #32749, #342249)
  * Build depend on transfig (closes: #321157)
  * Use gcc rather than gcc-3.4 to compile (closes: #323698)
  * Split xen-hypervisor and xen-utils
  * Build both xen-hypervisor and xen-hypervisor-pae packages
  * Julien Danjou <acid@debian.org>
     - Change maintainer and add uploaders field
     - Add force-reload support for init script xendomains
  * Guido Trotter <ultrotter@debian.org>
     - Add dpatch structure to the package
     - Remove build-dependency on gcc (it's build essential anyway)
     - Suggest xen-tools in the xen metapackage
  * Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>
     - Added changes from 3.0.1-0tha3
     - Removed patch generation from kernel source in debian/rules
     - added the static file debian/linux-2.6.12-xen.patch (which
       patches a vanilla 2.6.12 to 2.6.12.6-xen, but still with the
       extraversion stripped off)
     - Changed debian/linux-patch-xen.kpatches

xen (3.0.1-0tha3) unstable; urgency=low

  * updated to testing changeset 8743 (xen 3.0.1 + some patches)
  * added bash to dependencies, because some scripts actually needs it
    (even if only "/bin/sh" is set as interpreter in those scripts, so a
    better solution would be if upstream removes the bashisms at all).
    thx for the report by Paul Wagland <xen+paul@kungfoocoder.org>.
  * changed hotplug/udev dependency to: "hotplug | udev (>=0.059)", because
    older udev versions doesn't work with xen and then hotplug is needed.
  * changed debian/libxen3.0.install a bit, so that it will install
    the svmloader (for amd's pacifica) in future. so when svm support is
    available in the stable xen upstream (most likely in 3.0.2) it will gets
    installed without further changes needed in the install-file.
  * xendomains should get stopped before xend, even in a .prerm file ;-P
    (but maybe there is a better solution, because the domUs doesn't really
    needed to be stopped on an upgrade).

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Wed, 15 Feb 2006 22:00:00 +0100

xen (3.0.1-0tha2) unstable; urgency=low

  * added bcc to build-dependencies.it's needed for VMX, otherwise
    the vmxloader will not be compiled. The few people that are already
    happy VT-owners will like that ;)

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Wed, 01 Feb 2006 23:55:00 -0100

xen (3.0.1-0tha1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NEW UPSTREAM: xen-3.0.1 (in fact testing changeset 8738)
  * changed all python2.3 dependencies to just python,
    because this should help ubuntu users to use this package.
  * removed /usr/local/sbin from xen.install, because now all binaries
    are installed in /usr/sbin & /usr/bin instead (thx to upstream).
  * added /usr/include/xen/linux/*.h in libxen-dev.install

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Wed, 01 Feb 2006 18:45:00 -0100

xen (3.0.0-0tha13) unstable; urgency=low

  * NEW UPSTREAM: xen-3.0.0 + testing (changeset 8270)
  * fixed a critical bug in this package for amd64. libraries are not
    supposed to exist in /lib64 or /usr/lib64. Installing them in /lib or
    /usr/lib is the correct location, even on amd64 machines.
    Before -tha13 a libc6 upgrade will fail because of libraries in the
    wrong location. This is a xen package issue as well as an libc6 issue,
    but I can only fix the xen related ;-)
  * removed the useless "sarge is not allowed to use udev" dependency,
    because even if udev is too old in sarge, not allowing an installation 
    of udev will make xen not installable with for example gnome at the same 
    time. If udev is too old, xen will automaticly use hotplug, so this
    dependency can safely be removed.

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Sun, 22 Jan 2006 14:35:00 -0100

xen (3.0.0-0tha12) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "hmm, there is always something to fix" release...
  * changed the depends for udev to udev (>=0.059), because udev on
    sarge is too old for xen and if udev is installed it makes hotplug 
    not working as fallback. So on sarge udev is not allowed to be installed
    when xen is going to be installed anyway. (thx to Alvaro del Castillo for
    the report!)
  * Change the year in the changelog from 2005->2006 for entries from now on.
  * changed the kernel mirror from http://www.kernel.org to 
    ftp://ftp.de.kernel.org, because the main mirror is sometimes really slow 
    for european users. If someone want's to change that again, please edit 
    Config.mk
  * removed debian/TODO, because it was very old and not up-to-date...

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Thu, 17 Jan 2006 01:12:00 -0100

xen (3.0.0-0tha11) unstable; urgency=low

  * NEW UPSTREAM: xen-3.0.0 + testing (changeset 8269)
    This should fix some minor problem of the 3.0.0 release, see upsream
    changelog for details. Xen's project leader (Ian Pratt) advises to use
    testing for production systems at the moment, so I switched my
    xen3-stable release to testing for now.
    If you have build your own kernels for xen, then please rebuild it
    with the new linux-patch-xen to have the testing fixes in your kernel
    and so that hypervisor and dom0/domU kernel matches the changeset.
  * NEW: Binary images are available for dom0/domU kernels.
    You don't have to (but still can) compile your own kernel.
    Just install "linux-xen0-2.6" with apt-get from the same repository you
    got this package from and follow the instructions that will get shown.
    The kernel images are available for i386, i386-pae and amd64. They are
    available at least in sid and sarge. etch might have a not working
    "make-kpkg" at the moment, so there is probably no kernel image for etch
    at the moment (should change in future of course).
    The kernel images are not tested as well as the xen packages, so please
    let me know if you have any problems with the new kernel images at all.
  * xen now suggests: linux-xen0-2.6

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Sat, 14 Jan 2005 14:00:00 -0100

xen (3.0.0-0tha10) unstable; urgency=low

  * /etc/udev & /etc/hotplug stuff is now installed. Hotplug works at
    least on sarge & sid without problems, but maybe someone wants to
    use udev instead of hotplug, so from now on udev config is
    available as well.
  * changed xen's depencies to "hotplug | udev".

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Thu, 12 Jan 2005 01:30:00 -0100

xen (3.0.0-0tha9) unstable; urgency=low

  * moved all python libraries from xen to libxen-python.install, because
    otherwise they will be installed in the wrong version since the last
    change on debhelper/dh_install in sid/unstable. d'oh!
  * added bash to build-depencies, because of some bashisms in configure
    scripts in upstream (thx to Saku Ytti)
  * changed the handling of excludes for amd64 a bit to include all python
    files for amd64.
  * bridge-utils is now recommend not only suggested.
  * added libncurses5-dev to depencies as suggested by dpkg-shlibdeps
    (needed for xenmon.py ?)
  * the kernel-patch now will create a amd64 and i386 subdir and patch
    script. the diff is the same for both architectures (thx to Saku Ytti
    for pointing me on this).
  * NEXT TARGET: PROVIDING KERNEL IMAGES VIA PACKAGES.DEBIANBASE.DE FOR
    AT LEAST I386, I386-PAE AND AMD64 ON SARGE/SID/WOODY.

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Mon, 09 Jan 2005 23:40:00 -0100

xen (3.0.0-0tha8) unstable; urgency=low

  * xen.postinst now creates /var/lock/subsys and /var/lib/xen/save (if not
    already existing), because the xendomains init script tries to suspend
    running domainUs in /var/lib/xen/save/. without this the xendomains
    script is forced to shutdown each domainU when "xendomains stop" is
    executed.

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Wed, 21 Dec 2005 13:15:00 -0100

xen (3.0.0-0tha7) unstable; urgency=low

  * the linux-patch-xen package is now useable. The upstream version for
    creating kernel-patches doesn't work, so I had to find my own solution.
    The EXTRAVERSION (currently ".6-xen") gets stripped off, because 
    dh_installkpatches doesn't like to handle kernel-patches with EXTRAVERSIONS.
    But the linux-patch-xen patch patches a vanilla 2.6.12 kernel to 2.6.12.6-xen,
    even if EXTRAVERSION doesn't reflect that correctly.
    With make-kpkg you can add the EXTRAVERSION again with the flag: 
      --append-to-version .6-xen
  * make "XEN_TARGET_X86_PAE" an option in debian/rules, for easier switching
    between both compile options. 

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Sun, 19 Dec 2005 23:30:00 -0100

xen (3.0.0-0tha6) unstable; urgency=low

  * suggests "bridge-utils", because most people need it (bridge mode is std.)

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Sun, 18 Dec 2005 23:30:00 -0100

xen (3.0.0-0tha5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "AMD64"-Release
  * updated control file for amd64 (works now with i386 & amd64).
  * updated .install files (for new amd64 arch)
  * updated rules file (for new amd64 arch)
  * added manpages (they never were installed before)
  * added qemu keytabs (I forgot them on the update for xen3)

 -- Ralph Passgang <ralph@debianbase.de>  Sun, 18 Dec 2005 16:30:00 -0100

xen (3.0.0-0tha4) unstable; urgency=low

  * updated to gcc as default cc, because gcc-3.4 is not longer needed

xen (2.0.4-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bah, major booboo.  Add /boot to debian/xen.install, so xen.gz will
    get shipped.  Reported by Clint Adams <schizo@debian.org>.

 -- Adam Heath <doogie@brainfood.com>  Tue, 15 Feb 2005 13:00:57 -0600

xen (2.0.4-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix kernel patch generation.  It was broken when I integrated with
    debian's kernel source.  I used a symlink, and diff doesn't follow
    those.

 -- Adam Heath <doogie@brainfood.com>  Sat, 05 Feb 2005 18:16:35 -0600

xen (2.0.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream.
  * xen.deb can now install on a plain kernel; that is, the init scripts
    exit successfully if /proc/xen/privcmd doesn't exist.  This allows
    for dual-boot setups.
  * Manpages do not yet exist xend, xenperf, xensv, xfrd, nor xm.  xend
    xfrd are daemons, and take little if any options.  I've not had a need
    to use xenperf nor xensv yet.  xm has nice built in help(xm help).
  * Upstream now requires either linux 2.4.29, or 2.6.10.  Since 2.4.29 is
    not yet in debian, disable the 2.4 patch generation.  Closes: #271245.
  * Not certain how the kernel-patch-xen was empty.  It's not now, with
    the repackaging.  Closes: #272299.
  * Xen no longer produces kernel images, so problems about missing features
    are no longer valid.  Closes: #253924.
  * Acknowledge nmu bugs:
    * No longer build-depend on gcc 3.3, as the default gcc works. Closes:
      #243048.

xen (2.0.3-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream.  Closes: #280733.
  * Repackaged from scratch.
  * Using unreleased patch management system.  See debian/README.build.
    * After extracting the .dsc, there are no special steps needed
    * Those wanting to change the source, use the normal procedures for
      any package, including using interdiff(or other tool) to send a
      patch to me or the bts.
  * No longer try to do anything fancy with regard to the layout of the
    built kernels.  Now, only patches are distributed.  Please make use of
    the xen support in kernel-package.
  * Early preview release to #debian-devel.
