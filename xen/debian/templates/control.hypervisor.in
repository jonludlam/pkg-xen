Description: Xen Hypervisor on @class@
 The hypervisor is the "core" for XEN itself. It gets booted by the boot loader
 and controls cpu and memory, sharing them between your administrative domain
 (Domain 0) and the virtual guest systems.

 In order to boot a XEN system along with this package you also need a kernel
 specifically crafted to work as the Domain 0, mediating hardware access for
 XEN itself.
