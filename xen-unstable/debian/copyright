GNU General Public License
--------------------------

Most files in this repository are licensed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License (GPL), a copy of which is attached at the end
of this notice. Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as
the files in this repository are concerned is _this_ particular
version of the license (i.e., *only* v2, not v2.2 or v3.x or
whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.

On Debian systems, the complete text of the GNU General
Public License can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL'.

Licensing Exceptions (the relaxed BSD-style license)
----------------------------------------------------

For the convenience of users and those who are porting OSes to run as
Xen guests, certain files in this repository are not subject to the
GPL when distributed separately or included in software packages
outside this repository. Instead we specify a much more relaxed
BSD-style license. Affected files include the Xen interface headers
(xen/include/public/COPYING), and various drivers, support functions
and header files within the Linux sparse source trees. In all such
cases, license terms are stated at the top of the file or in a COPYING
file in the same directory. Note that _any_ file that is modified and
then distributed within a Linux kernel is still subject to the GNU GPL.
